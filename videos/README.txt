These links lead to VideoLink, a way to circumvent the block on YouTube.
You need to copy and paste (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V) to use the link.
Currently has:
- 8 official soundtracks from Juke's Towers of Hell
- 2 Whitepine episodes (by ivorycello)

If you want your own unblocked video, follow these instructions. 
1. Search up your video on YouTube, and locate it. If the thumbnail is a blocked image, you'll need VideoLink to watch it.
2. Get a tab on the main page of video.link ready.
3. When you have both of these tabs open, drag the thumbnail of the video to the VideoLink tab. After around a second, your browser will switch to the VideoLink tab. Now, you can move the thumbnail to where it says [Enter YouTube URL]
4. Click [Generate Link] and it should open a tab where you can watch the video with no problems. If it says "Video may contain offensive content".. then you're out of luck. Sorry!
