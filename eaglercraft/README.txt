Eaglercraft Information

Resource Pack
Resource packs can either improve performance or make the game look cooler. There is not one in this folder due to file size limits, but you can find them pretty easily.
To enable the pack, click [Options] on the main menu, click [Resource Packs], click [Open resource pack], and then select the resource pack file.
Skins + Capes
To change your skin on Eagler, click [Add Skin] on the first screen, and select your skin. It ONLY WORKS in the .png format, and you can use websites such as Tynker to make custom skins.
Capes can be changed by clicking the Capes button in the top left on the skin selector screen.
