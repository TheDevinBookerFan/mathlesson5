Exthang3r is Chrome's deadliest exploit. Here's how to use it.

1. Go to copy-me.txt and paste the text into your browser. It should open the Exthang3r page.
2. Select Lightspeed Filter Agent, and click [Hang Extension!].
3. After about a minute, a button with the text [Kill Extension!] will appear. Click it.
4. Go to chrome://extensions/?id=adkcpkpghahmbopkjchobieckeoaoeem and flip the [Allow access to file URLs] switch twice.
5. After this, the exploit should be active. Keep the tab open, and you will be able to visit any website.
6. To disable the exploit, flip the switch one more time (or reboot your computer.)
