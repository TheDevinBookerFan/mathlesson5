# Math Lesson 5

# Instructions on how to play
Some of these are HTML files, which you simply need to open. You can open your Files menu by clicking the button on the bottom left of your Chromebook taskbar, and then clicking Files. A select few are .txt files, which have a link to the download (to avoid file size limits.) For .zip files, you have to open them until you find an index.html file. Opening that will launch the game. Some folders have extra instructions - *if a certain folder contains a README.txt you should probably read it*
# Instructions on how to play - The Emulator
This isn't released yet.. not fully anyways. The full version of the emulator folder releases on 11/9/2024, be there or be sad :(
# How to submit suggestions
This requires a GitHub account. Go to the Issues tab, submit a DETAILED suggestion please. I may not accept it, but I most likely will if it is a good idea.
# Other information
I am.. not very good at github so I have no clue how to use this platform. More stuff will be added when i figure out how.
