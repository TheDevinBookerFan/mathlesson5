# Math Lesson 5
some unblocked games I have found.
This is the MathLesson5 repo.. have fun!!!!!! DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS!
NONE OF THESE GAMES ARE MADE BY ME - i wont get sued but just in case yk?
# Instructions on how to play
Some of these are HTML files, which you simply need to open. For .zip files, you have to open them until you find an index.html file. Opening that will launch the game.
# Plans for v1.1.0
Antimatter Dimensions will be added when I figure out how to go around the file size limit.
Files will be organized into different folders. 
Lastly, the repository will be unprivated.
More Jacorb games will be added.
# Other information
I am.. not very good at github so I have no clue how to use this platform. More stuff will be added when i figure out how.
